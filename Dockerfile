# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal
# runtime dependencies for the application. This often uses a different base
# image from the build stage where the necessary files are copied from the build
# stage.
#
# The example below uses the debian bullseye image as the foundation for running the app.
# By specifying the "bullseye-slim" tag, it will also use whatever happens to be the
# most recent version of that tag when you build your Dockerfile. If
# reproducibility is important, consider using a digest
# (e.g.,    debian@sha256:ac707220fbd7b67fc19b112cee8170b41a9e97f703f588b2cdbbcdcecdd8af57).
